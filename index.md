		<h2>Who&rsquo;s invited?</h2>
		<p>Anybody who indentifies as kinky and works in technology &mdash; be it in the privacy of your own home, or publicly on the scene. You don't have to be a programmer, you just have to be geeky or involved in technology in some way.</p>

		<h2>Channels</h2>
		<p>Slack chat spaces are divided into rooms called &ldquo;channels&rdquo;, and we have several dozen set up. There are two you&rsquo;ll be in by default:</p>
		<ul class="no-bullets">
			<li><span class="label radius">#announcements:</span> occasional announcements</li>
			<li><span class="label radius">#chat:</span> random chat</li>
		</ul>
		<p>All rooms are opt-in except <span class="label radius">announcements</span>, which is why it is kept low-volume.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="medium-6 columns">
		<h2>What are the rules?</h2>
		<p>We have a simple and uncontroversial <a href="/coc.html">Code of Conduct</a>.</p> <p><span class="label radius">TL;DR:</span> be nice, and what happens inside generally stays there unless someone specifically says otherwise.</p>
